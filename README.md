# MyDlink motion detection notification

MyDlink camera is great with its own sound and motion detection but it's not very useful because it seems slow and only doing email notification.

I want to run my own motion detection and do a serial of things when an incident occurs such as play sound, call me, or text me

# Requirement

# Dev
```
$ npm i nodemon -g
$ nodemon index.js
```
